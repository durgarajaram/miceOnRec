First of all make sure that MAUS is installed and the environment is loaded (source env.sh)

To build the code do

  cd build
  cmake ../src/
  make



This will create two example offline executables in mic11/bin. For instructions on how to use the examples do:

  ./stexample --help

or

  ./mtexample --help



In order to start the Online reconstruction do:

  nohup ./start_onrec.sh &>>start_onrec.log &


The reconstructed output will show up in mic11/output.
